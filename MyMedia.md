I Liked the book name **Rich Dad and Poor Dad**.It's a good book and highly recommend. The book can be classified as a beach read, given its non-academic writing style. As an individual who mirrors the book's description of a 'poor dad,' being well-educated through the formal college system, I initially found it challenging to align with the logic of the 'rich dad.
